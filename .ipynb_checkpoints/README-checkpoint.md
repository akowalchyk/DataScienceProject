# Apple Music Statistics
#### By Adam Kowalchyk

### Introduction
This is a quantified self-project that gives a detailed analysis of my families Apple Music Account. Techniques used in this project to portray data include Visualizations, Hypothesis Testing, and Classification. 
### How to Run
The Technical report only uses the utyls.py as an external folder, everything else is ran inside of the technical report. If running the code in the Technical Report, make sure to run the cells from top to bottom to ensure correct data. Also, make sure that utyls.py has been updated correctly so the graphs in the Technical Report can be showed correctly.
